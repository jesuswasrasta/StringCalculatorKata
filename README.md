String Calculator
=================

[String Calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

The following is a TDD Kata - an exercise in coding, refactoring and test-first - that you should apply daily for at least 15 minutes (I do 30).  
Before you start: 

    Try not to read ahead.
    Do one task at a time. 
        The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
    Make sure you only test for correct inputs. 
        There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata

String Calculator

* Create a simple String calculator with a method int __Add__(_string numbers_)
    * the method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example ``""`` or ``"1"`` or ``"1,2"``
    * start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
    * remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
    * _remember to refactor after each passing test_
* Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
* Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
    * the following input is ok: ``"1\n2,3"`` (will equal 6)
    * the following input is NOT ok: ``"1,\n"`` (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
* Support different delimiters
    * to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: ``"//[delimiter]\n[numbers]"``  
    for example ``"//;\n1;2"`` should return three where the default delimiter is ``';'``.
    * the first line is optional. All existing scenarios should still be supported
* Calling _Add_ with a negative number will throw an exception "negatives not allowed" - and the negative that was passed.
    * if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message stop here if you are a beginner. 
    * Continue if you can finish the steps so far in less than 30 minutes.
* Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2
* Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:  ``"//[delimiter]\n"`` for example: ``"//[***]\n1***2***3"`` should return 6
* Allow multiple delimiters like this:  ``"//[delim1][delim2]\n"`` for example ``"//[*][%]\n1*2%3"`` should return 6.
    * make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
